Generate a **Pod** named `app-two-containers` with one `emptyDir` volume `html`. It must run two containers: **1st** on image `nginx` mounting `html` at `/usr/share/nginx/html`, and **2nd** on image `debian` mounting the same volume at `/html` and executing an endless shell loop that appends the current date to `/html/index.html` every second (`command: ["/bin/sh","-c"]`, `args` as the while-loop). No additional ports or resources. Return only YAML.
