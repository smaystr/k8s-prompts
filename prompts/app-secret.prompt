Generate a **Pod** named `app-secret` that runs one container **mypod** on image `redis`. The container must mount a volume **foo** sourced from an existing Secret `secrret1` at mountPath `/etc/foo` with `readOnly: true`. Declare the volume in `spec.volumes`; no other resources. Return **only YAML**.
